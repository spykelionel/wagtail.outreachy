# Introduction

ðŸ‘‹ Hello, everyone! I'm Spyke Lionel, a Python/Django Developer based in Cameroon. I'm thrilled to be part of the Outreachy program with Wagtail and excited to introduce myself to this amazing community.

As a passionate advocate of open-source development, I've always been drawn to projects like Wagtail that empower creators with user-friendly tools. Joining this project not only aligns with my interests but also provides an opportunity to connect with fellow developers and contribute to the growth of the open-source community.

While this is my first time participating in Outreachy, I have been an avid supporter of open source for years and have contributed to various projects in the past. In addition to my Python coding skills, I have a keen interest in Machine Learning, particularly deep learning, and I'm constantly exploring new ways to merge the worlds of code and intelligent systems.

When I'm not immersed in code, you'll likely find me immersed in a good book or enjoying the rhythms of some soulful music. I believe in the power of continuous learning and personal growth, and I'm excited to embark on this journey with the Outreachy and Wagtail communities. Let's create something amazing together! Once again, it's nice meeting y'all.
